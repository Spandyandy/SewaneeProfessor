  <h1>ABOUT OUR WEBSITE</h1>
  <br><br>
   <p>   <span style="color:red;">  This website is going to completely revolutionize the way students view professor’s information!</span>  Students can look up detailed information 
  about Sewanee Professors before registering for classes. The information on this site includes each Professor’s full name, contact information, 
  picture, office location, courses he/she teaches, and office hours. Our website has a feature to rank professors from high to low by their popularity 
  based on how many likes they get from students. This website also assists students in searching professors by the subjects they teach so students can 
  easily look up who is teaching particular course and the rating of the professor. The aim of our website is to unify different information of professors 
  in one website. </p><br>
	<p>      Users who are not currently enrolled in Sewanee should only be able to look up information of professors while students will be able to sign up for 
	this website to “like” professors and bookmark professor or course students choose to look at frequently. When students sign up, they need to provide 
	information which includes username (not real name), password, Sewanee email, and majors (optional). This website contains “like” button for each 
	professor’s page and students are able to “like” each professor only once and they can “like” as many professors as they want. This “like” system is 
	more credible than “ratemyprofessor.com”, because each students will not affect overall rating of the professor as much. Every user will be able to 
	delete their account and their information and reviews will be deleted. </p><br>
  <p>      We want professors to completely manage their information on their site so that any of their details on the site are approved for public viewing by them. 
Therefore, we will ask professors to put in their information by themselves on the site. Any other fields, except for their names, will be completely 
optional to place, and information that has already been placed can also be modified by them. 
As soon as possible, we will ask a few professors to help us by providing their information on the site, and any professors that have not yet supplied 
their information will have a message on their pages showing that the information is not yet available, although students will still be able to like and 
bookmark these professors. Students will also be encouraged to check and test our website to give us feedback on our website’s readability, usefulness, 
and understandability. </p><br>

   <p><br>Any complaints, praises, questions or free money can be directed to us using the contact information at the bottom of this page. 
   Thanks for visiting!!!! </p>
